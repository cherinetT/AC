        <p title=" Autonomic Computing">
          Autonomic computing is a vital part of IBM'S future vision and it means making computers that can take care of
          themselves. Computers would automatically diagnose their own problem and fix them reasoning out how to
          protect themselves from future viruses, software bugs, and hard ware breakdowns. The machines would become in
          IBM CEO Sam Palmisano’s words "self-protecting, self-healing, self-optimizing and self-configuring”.
          Autonomic computing systems have the ability to manage themselves and to dynamically adapt to change in
          accordance with evolving or dynamic business policies and objectives. These systems can perform management
          activities based on situations they observe or sense in the IT environment rather than IT professionals
          initiating management activities. The system observes something about it self and acts accordingly. This
          allows the IT professional to focus on high value tasks while the technology manages the more mundane
          operations. This paper will focus on autonomic computing its characteristics, the pro and cons and its
          architecture.
