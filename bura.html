      Architecture of Autonomic computing
      The unconventional architecture of autonomic computing contains two entities: Autonomic Element and Autonomic
      Manager. This architecture consists an adaptable and malleable infrastructure for all basic components of any
      self-managed system that mitigate IT professionals from convolution associated with depiction, expansion and
      organizing autonomous systems.It contains an autonomiccontrol loop that domineer the flow of work done between sub
      constituents of autonomic elements.
      Autonomic Management
      The design architecture of autonomic management system is to give advice to the autonomic manager about sustaining
      precise software architecture. This architecture enables autonomic
      manager’s work by delaying implementation decisions by the management of variation points. This middle manager
      entity must have to assure the runtime system integrate to the reference architecture. Autonomic management
      provides four characteristics of self-managed systems i.e., Self-healing, Self-optimizing, Self-protecting and
      <br>Self-configuring. These characteristics propose additional following self-capabilities.<br>
      a. Self-aware- The capabilities of self-managed system are apprehensions and knowing of what happens inside and
      outside both at present through prophecy.<br>
      b. Self-adjusting- The abilities are modifications to any situation which controls internal system specification
      with respect to matching needs.<br>
      c. Self-situating- The potentials are independent to self-management abilities.
      Furthermore, all above self-capabilities provide system with amplified characteristics: Anticipation and Openness.
      Autonomic control Loop<br>
      The autonomic control loop accomplishes four event driven tasks which are as follow:
      a. Collect all the application requirements from the environment sensors and in favor of user context knowledge
      base.
