      The main application of autonomic computing is its self-healing systems. This technique aims to detect and repair
      any existing error and enable the system in to a reconfiguring action without any assistance from a human being.
      Autonomic computing was introduced by IBM to manage the complexity faced in the IT system. As the fundament of IT
      sector is heterogeneous,it requires competent influence. Autonomic computing brought a revolution to the IT
      industry by designing the computing systems which are self-managed. It has provided high speed,maintenance,and
      enabled essential functionaries without much human participation.Autonomic computing has plundered in to
      networking,data management,storage and data centers .Thus the architecture of autonomic computing is being used in
      various sectors of industry. It has enabled the capability of self-healing, self-protection etc. Which solve the
      complexity in system. This process of managing complex systems by various autonomous elements can be applied
      across networking systems,applications and services.<br><br>
      1 Application of autonomic computing as self-healing systems: - the main application of autonomic computing is its
      self-healing systems.it increases the reliability and stability of the system by continuously monitoring and
      checking the components.It checks the self-awareness system and detects any errors,and while it does that,the
      system returns to the previously used version and the defined algorithms to detect the point of the errors.This
      technique aims to detect and repair any existing error and enable the system into a reconfiguring action without
      any assistance from a human being.IT industry was in dire need of a computer system that would make the
      professionals spend less time troubleshooting the problems and more on actual completion of the tasks.It runs
      regression tests to modify its own behavior with a response to any changes in the environment. Self-healing
      systems maintain a satisfactory quality of the systems during runtime to avoid any improper conduct of the
      computer systems during run time to avoid any improper conduct of the computer systems.That is the first phase of
      the cycle. The second phase of the cycle is to identity the error and diagnoses it. The third phase is to plan a
      corrective action related to the error. Once the errors are troubleshot,the cycle begins again.<br><br>
      2 Application of Autonomic computing in transportation system: - The general idea of autonomy in the transport
      system is to manage the systems that are so complex that it's a must that they are configured and optimized by
      themselvesBased on the idea of autonomic systems,it aligns the idea of transport studies and computer science that
      will give rise to a new system of the transport system.The traffic flow will be optimized in urban areas with the
      necessity to solve the decision making problems of the road operators.The basic structure of the control system
      comprises the sensors of various types to implement control solutions by devices and systems. The process is
      subject to human traffic manager who handles the traffic according to their understanding. These components are
      predicted to be included in the optimization process. The optimization also includes various sound inputs like
      weather conditions and driver decisions which cannot be estimate.<br><br>
      3 Application of autonomic computing in virtualized environment: - Virtualization is the technique of
      differentiating the resources of the system in to various execution environments. With the help of
      virtualization,the data is safely migrated through virtual machine models.It carries out major migrating
      activities while the operating system run without any interruption, and this minimizes the service downtimes
      through virtualization,migration can beconducted offline.<br><br>
      4 Application of Autonomic computing in business sector: - the autonomic computing models are differently
      remodeled to suit the current business structure. Some of its applications can be seen in customer relationship
      management.The automated CRM manages the complexity that arises every day. The automated structure manages lead in
      a loop which is a self-optimizing component.A simple algorithm manages and analyzes any errors relating to budget
      allocation,allocation of resources,revenue generated,and the execution of leads.Autonomic computing also manages
      pricing policies through various schemes that are available. It also collects data through various modules and
      formulated inventory management. Parameters such as stock,market informationand the supplier information are
      checked.<br><br>
      5 Autonomic computer in traffic control: the traffic control system follows the concept of bi-level formalism. It
      integrates the functionalities of the transportations systems. It manages the relative duration as well as the
      cycle of the signals. It decreases the optimization problems while increasing the solution space.The control
      processes target the optimization of transport behavior. It also defines maximal and minimal values apart from the
      additional traffic characteristics.It keeps the network capacity and the nominal level whenever any sort of
      congestion appears in the network links. Autonomic computing minimizes the event of over saturation and spills
      back the network links.
